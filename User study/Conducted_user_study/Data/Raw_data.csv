Also, the thumbnail gave me a certain idea of whether the place was being worth visiting or not. Since the images of the interior of the statue of liberty were somehow distorted, I quickly decided not to bother visiting other places inside the statue. The thumbnails helped me to decide if a certain place was worth my time.","Blinking Icon","The blinking icons were placed sparsely in the area to be discovered. Also, the general direction of the closest blinking icon was not indicated to the visitor. Therefore, using this method to navigate the area is frustrating. It felt more like a mediocre video game than a visit (albeit virtual) at this place. The most annoying factor was surprisingly not being unable to jump across the map (obviously, with this kind of navigation you can only jump to points visible from your current location) but having to search for the next location as if I was taking part in a poorly designed scavenger hunt.","There is no such thing as the perfect navigation for everyone out there. Compromising is a must. In my opinion, the tour to the statue of liberty solved this in a elegant manner by simply offering three different ways to navigate. It worked, because the blinking icons were relatively sparse and therefore did not interfere with the other navigation methods (which I preferred in this case). If they would have used arrows to click on in order to move seamlessly across the map, this approach would not have worked out. The Zugspitze tour, on the other hand, provided seamless navigation (if desired) accompanied by the voice of guides along the route. It felt more like a real trekking tour due to the continuity in my movement across the map. I understand that the statue of liberty is probably to big of an accessible area to offer this, but for me, the visit there did not feel like a real visit because of this. 
I would have liked to be offered an automatic tour across the area, almost like a video produced for VR sets, so that I do not have to click all the time. That would have been a nice addition to the already existing options."
