# Virtual Tourism Applications

Virtual tourism applications have become increasingly important, especially in the
present time with the spread of COVID-19. Virtual tourism allows to discover
different countries, cities or sights remotely. In this work, the term virtual tourism
is defined and an overview of the different applications is given by dividing them
into categories and showing their characteristics. Furthermore, a user study is
developed in which the interaction and navigation types of two applications are
investigated. The results from the evaluation of the user study are then used to
improve each navigation type. These changes are implemented and presented in
mockups. Finally, guidelines are presented that can be applied independently of
the presented navigations when implementing a virtual tourism application.These
include how to highlight a navigation type, how to best bring its functionality closer
to the user, and how many navigation types should be used.
